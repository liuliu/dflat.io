Thanks **Wouter van Oortmerssen** for the flatbuffers serialization format, which introduced an excellent schema upgrade path.

Thanks **Dr. Hipp** for SQLite implementation that enabled a reasonable foundational data persistent mechanism.

Thanks **Guillaume Lessard** for the SwiftAtomics implementation, it is a shame that Swift doesn't have a good atomic primitives and we have to guess.

Thanks **Snap**. While was employed there, I was able to build several structured data persistence mechanisms that becomes the predecessors of **Dflat**.

Thanks **Aaron Levine**, for the idea of writing an open-source implementation of the proprietary system we developed together at Snap when I am in my retirement.
